# Basic Python
## Introduction
Investigate how the number of votes a TV show title receives from IMDb users impacts its ratings. The TV show data is from the "Golden Age of Television" starting in 1999 up until the current date. The assumption is that highly-rated shows have the most votes.
## Project
- Data was loaded in and general information was looked into
- The data was then preprocessed to fix impurities
- The data was analyzed to look at the votes compared to ratings
## Conclusion
The research done confirms that highly-rated shows released during the "Golden Age" of television also have the most votes. While shows with score 4 have more votes than ones with scores 5 and 6, the top three (scores 7-9) have the largest number. The data studied represents around 94% of the original set, so we can be confident in our findings.
