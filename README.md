# My Data Science Journey with Triple Ten
Hello my name is Parker Statler. I am a student at Triple Ten, honing my skills as a data scientist/analyst. My pogression through TripleTen's data science bootcamp has allowed me to discover my gratification to dicover insights from given data. The course has allowed me to master machine learning to make predictions, along with many other skills including python, SQL, etc. Here are some of the projects accomplished throughout the course.
