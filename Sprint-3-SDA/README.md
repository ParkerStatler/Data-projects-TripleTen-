# Statistical Data Analysis
## Introduction
The company, Megaline, offers its clients two prepaid plans, Surf and Ultimate. The commercial department wants to know which of the plans brings in more revenue in order to adjust the advertising budget. Analyze clients' behavior and determine which prepaid plan brings in more revenue.
## Project
- Data from five datasets were loaded in:
  - plan
  - users
  - calls
  - messages
  - internet
- Each dataset's information was looked at for preprocessing
- Datasets were merged into one
- Revenue was calculated for each user
  - A function was defined for calculations
  - The function was then used on a new column to add revenue for each user
- User behavior was studied between calls, messages, and internet
  - Graphs were made to look at the differences between plans
  - Mean, standard deviation, and variance were also looked at between plans
- Revenue between plans was then analyzed
- Hypothesis testing was performed to test id the average revenue from users of the Ultimate and Surf calling plans differs.
## Conclusions
Given that the surf plan has almost double the users of the ultimate plan, and doesn't trail the ultimate plan in average revenue per user by very much, it would be smart to target a plan with a cheaper monthly pay. We were able to conclude in our analysis that we can reject that the plans generate equal revenue.
