# Data Collection and Storage
## Introduction
Working as an analyst for a new ride-sharing company Zuber, find patterns in the available information. Understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides. Analyze data from competitors and test a hypothesis about the impact of weather on ride frequency.
## Project
- Three datasets were loaded in and initially looked at:
  - results_01 - taxi companies and their number of trips
  - results_04 - average trips per dropoff location
  - result_07 - Start time for each trip, weather condition, and duration of trip
- The top ten neighborhoods in terms of dropoffs were looked at
- Number of rides for each taxi company was looked at
- The hypothesis that he average duration of rides from the Loop to O'Hare International Airport changes on rainy Saturdays was tested
  - It was concluded that the weather does affect the average duration of rides from Loop to O'Hare International Airport
## Conclusion
The top four most relevant neighborhoods were Loop, River North, Streeterville, and West Loop. Flash Cab dominates with almost 20,000 rides, everyone else falls under 12,000 rides. After seeing if weather affects average duration of rides from Loop to O'Hare International Airport, it can be assumed that weather does affect the average duration of rides.
